 # PitchBook-Data-Case-Study-Proposal
A Fin-Tech overview on PitchBook; a company that provides financial data, news and analysis to subscription based customers about venture capital, private equity, and M&A Transactions.

## Overview and Origin
* PitchBook was incorporated in 2009 by Founder & CEO John Gabbert in Seattle, Washington. Gabbert's inspiration for PitchBook came after his former employer cut the financial data services offered to customers. Initially, the company received an investment of $3.8 million from Morningstar and angel investors. Additionally, they received $10 million in January of 2016 from Morningstar and were later fully acquired by Morningstar in December 2016. PitchBook continues to run under its original name and founder. 

## Business Activities
* The specific financial problem PitchBook is trying to solve is the lack of availability and accuracy of private equity deal data for customers by providing data, news, and analysis to venture capital and private equity industires.  PitchBook has served as the official data provider of the Association for Corporate Growth (ACG) since 2009, and they work with ACG chapters world wide. While providing data to large corporate businesses may have been the sole mission when the company began, PitchBook has shown support to industry organizations and business schools by providing special access to PitchBook and supporting related school and company events. Some of the various companies PitchBook has entered partnerships with include National Venture Capital Association,  XPONEAT, *All*Raise, British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, Falk Marques Group, & Kayo.
* Pitchbook now offers 120,000+ unique market size estimates for 30,000+ markets, and as of May 2020, the market size is adding hundreds by the day. PitchBook offers data that covers the whole life-cycle of the venture capital industry. This data includes unlimited partners, partner's commitment to the funds, performance of funds, and then investing that capital into early stage businesses. PitchBook Data uses more than 650,000 web crawlers to collect data, natural language processing and machine learning technology to organize and filter data, Apache HTTP Server, Amazon CloudFront, Apache Tomcat, Google Analytics, Otimizely, and Crazy Egg. They have created a desktop and mobile version of PitchBook, as well as an Excel Plugin, Chrome Extension, CRM Integration and, using API, have allowed customers to integrate their existing systems with PitchBook data.

## Landscape:
* PitchBook's domain of the financial industry is capital investment and wealth management. Prior to COVID-19, PitchBookData shifted the transparency in VC firms by providing thoroughly researched data to assist customers in making educated decisions on whether or not to invest, reducing risk.  The impact of COVID-19 has been staunch in this domain, making trends virtually unpredictable; a new trend has formed: "companies are cutting costs to survive in an uncertain market". Successful companies can take 10-15 years to grow and be successful but since the pandemic, the shift of business standpoints have "shifted from profitability to survival", according to the managing director at General Catalyst. Over the last 10 years seed investing emerged as a class of its own via platforms like PitchBook, which has led to new businesses to receive funding more rapidly. However, the market is seeing a lot of regression as seed below $1million are closer to that of statistics in 2012 & 2017 which is due to seed funds investing in fewer startups for more equity. As far as competitors in the field, Mattermark, CB Insights (among the most pricy), Prequin, Keplar, & DataFox are among a few. 


## Results
* The impact of the company has been significant, as aforementioned, they are partnered with ACG & NVCA.


## Recommendations
* A general recommendation for PitchBook would be to create an algorithm using Python that would reject the J-curve generic exponential growth model as the basis of a company's growth potential and create a new model that projects firm growth with a new formula. Due to COVID and the climate of the market, the traditional method of growth will not be accurate and companies may be excluded from funding due to inaccurate data projections.   

If you were to advise the company, what products or service would you suggest they offer? [this could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination],I would offer 
why do you thing that offering this product or service would benefit the company? What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
